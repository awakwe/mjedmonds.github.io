## Chapter 4: Procedural Abstraction & Functions

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## Procedures & Functions

- All executable code resides within a **function**
- So far, the only function we have written is called **main**, which served as the entry point for our programs.
- A **function** is a named block of code that performs a task and then returns control to a caller.
  - The **caller** is the function that **invoked** the function
  - The **callee** is the function being **invoked**
  - You can think of the caller as the "parent" to the callee
- Because a function is just a block of code, we can call it multiple times throughout a program's execution
- After finishing, the function will branch back (return) to the caller.
- Consider this trivial example:
  - Suppose you want to print out the first 5 squares of numbers, do some processing, then print out the first 5 squares again. So far, we may write something like

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
  for(int i=1; i <= 5; i++)
  {
    cout << i*i << endl;
  }
  // amazing things
  for(int i=1; i <= 5; i++)
  {
    cout << i*i << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

- We wrote the same loop twice!
  - This is bad.
  - If we want to modify this code, to say print the first 5 cubes of numbers, we'd have to change code in two places
  - If we write a function to print the first 5 squares of numbers and call that function twice:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void print_squares(void)
{
  for(int i=1; i <=5; i++)
  {
    cout << i*i << endl;
  }
}

int main(void)
{
  print_squares();
  // amazing things
  print_squares();
  return 0;
}
```

## Functions

- Functions operate as _black boxes_, meaning they take input (parameters/arguments), do something with the input (function body), and spit out the answer (return value)
  - A function may not require any input at all (like our example above) and it may not return anything (like our example above - printing is not a form of returning).
- Terminology:
  - A function _f_ that uses another function _g_ is said to _call g_ (i.e. _f_ is the caller of _g_). * A function's inputs are known as its arguments (or parameters).
  - A function _g_ that gives some kind of data back to the caller _f_ is said to return that data.
- Let's look at a function to square the input of an integer:

### Calling functions

- We can call functions written by other programmers or write our own functions
- The following `math.cpp` program looks at some math functionality provided by the `<cmath>` library.

### math.cpp

```cpp
// This program demonstrates how you can use the standard math
// functions available in <cmath>

#include <iostream>          // for std::cout
#include <cmath>             // for floor(x),ceil(x),fabs(x) & sqrt(x)
using namespace std;         // supports cout

int main( )
{
  double value = 0.0, floor_value, ceil_value, fabs_value, sqrt_value;

  cout << "Please enter a value for computations: " << endl;
  cin  >> value;

  floor_value = floor( value );
  ceil_value  = ceil( value );
  fabs_value  = fabs( value );
  sqrt_value  = sqrt( value );

  cout << "\t floor_value = " << floor_value << endl;
  cout << "\t ceil_value  = " << ceil_value  << endl;
  cout << "\t fabs_value  = " << fabs_value  << endl;
  cout << "\t sqrt_value  = " << sqrt_value  << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

### User-defined functions

- We can also write functions ourselves. This allows us to reuse the same functionality as many times as needed.
- Let's first start with an example that walks through the components of a function

```c++
// the first int indicates that this function will return an integer to the caller
// square is the name of the function
// everything inside of the () are the function's arguments
// int x specifies a single argument named x of type int
int square(int x)
{
  // function body start
  int square_of_x;
  square_of_x = x * x;
  // return indicates what variable's value we return to the caller
  return square_of_x;
}
```

- A much simpler implementation:

```c++
int square(int x)
{
   return x * x;
}
```

### Function Syntax

- Functions take the form:

```c++
rtype name(type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ...)
{
  /* function body code */
}
```

- _rtype_ is the return type of the function
  - Could be `int`, `float`, etc
  - Can be `void` to indicate no return value
    - When a function is `void` type, you do not place a `return` in the function body
    - Example void function

```c++
void print_hello(int number_of_times)
{
  for(int i=1; i <= number_of_times; i++) {
    cout << "Hello!\n";
  }
}
```

- What about a function that takes no arguments?

```c++
float calculate_number() // or you can explicitly place void as the argument -> e.g. (void)
{
  float result=1;
  for(int i=0; i < 100; i++) {
    result += 1;
    result = 1/result;
  }
  return result;
}
```


### Function declarations

- A _function declaration_ tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters.
- So far, we have looked at _function definitions_, which provide the actual code a function will execute.
- We can declare a function without defining it (similar to declaring a variable without initializing it)
- Function declarations take the following form:

```c++
rtype function_name(type1 arg1, type2 arg2);
```

- Notice the semicolon at the end - this is a statement in C
- Why bother with this?
  - Function declarations typically exist in header files (.h), and their corresponding definitions exist in a .c file of the same name
  - For instance, we have been writing `#include <stdio.h>`, which includes the stdio header
  - Many times people put `main()` at the top of their program, so a fellow programmer can see the program's entry point first
    - But a compiler reads a program top-to-bottom, so if you reference a function before the compiler is aware of its existence, the compiler won't know what to do (we'll see an example of this in a second)
  - But even for more complex programs, it's nice to see all of the functions in one area without having to scroll through every definition. Provides an overview of the functions available.
- Look back at our `print_squares` example. `print_squares` is before `main`. Let's try to move it after `main`:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
  print_squares();
  // amazing things
  print_squares();
  return 0;
}

void print_squares(void)
{
  int i;
  for(i=1; i <=5; i++)
  {
    cout << i*i << endl;
  }
}
```

- We'll get a compiler error when we try to build this. Why?
  - When the compiler reads line 5, it has no idea what `print_squares` is. Function declarations let us tell the compiler: "This function will be defined later. When the linker executes (third stage of compilation), this function will be defined, compiled, and ready for linking"
- Let's add a function declaration to fix:

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void print_squares(void);

int main(void)
{
  print_squares();
  // amazing things
  print_squares();
  return 0;
}

void print_squares(void)
{
  int i;
  for(i=1; i <=5; i++)
  {
    cout << i*i << endl;
  }
}
```

- It builds! The compiler is aware that `print_squares` is a function and will be defined later.

### math2.cpp

- As another example, let's rewrite our `math.cpp` example above using a user-defined function

```cpp
// This program demonstrates how you can define and use functions.
// This program duplicates the functionality of MathFuncs.cpp

#include <iostream>          // for std::cout
#include <cmath>             // for floor(x),ceil(x),fabs(x) & sqrt(x)
using namespace std;         // supports cout

// precondition:  double argument assigned a value
// postcondition: floor, ceil, fabs and sqrt of argument is computed
//                and printed out to standard output
int compute_and_print( double d );

int main( )
{
  double value1 = 0.0, value2;

  cout << "Please enter two values for computations: " << endl;
  cin  >> value1 >> value2;

  compute_and_print( value1 );
  compute_and_print( value2 );
  return 0;
}

// this function allows us to reuse code without copying and pasting large blocks of code
int compute_and_print( double d ) {
  cout << "\t floor_value = " << floor( d ) << endl;
  cout << "\t ceil_value  = " << ceil( d )  << endl;
  cout << "\t fabs_value  = " << fabs( d )  << endl;
  cout << "\t sqrt_value  = " << sqrt( d )  << endl;

  return 0;
}
```


### Static functions

- Static functions can only be called from the file in which they were written
- This helps protect functionality from being available in other files. Essentially makes the function private to this particular file
- Example:

```c++
static int less_than( int a, int b )
{
    return (a < b) ? a : b;
}
```

## Calling functions

- Say we wanted to call the `calculate_number` function.
- Remember this function takes no arguments and returns a float
- We would write:

```c++
float f;
f = calculate_number();
```

- If you do not assign the return value to a variable, the return value is discarded (will not error).
- What if the function takes arguments?

```c++
int square_of_10;
square_of_10 = square(10);
```

- We can also pass appropriately (correctly) typed variables instead of literals

```c++
int square_of_x;
int x = 10;
square_of_x = square(x);
```

- C will attempt to type cast whatever you pass into the appropriate type.
  - For instance, if you pass a floating point number for an int argument, the floating point number will be type cast into an int
- If the function doesn't return anything, simply call the function

```c++
print_hello();
```

## Local variables

- Variables declared inside functions are local to that function
  - If you declare variables inside a function, they are only available in the function
  - This is called *scope*
- Scope
  - Local variables conform to the rules of "block scope"
  - The code block (denoted by `{}`) determines the scope of variables
  - Blocks can be nested, as we've seen with `if` statements inside of `main`
- Let's look at an example showcasing scope

### scope.cpp

```cpp
// This program demonstrates how variable scope occurs.
// Look at how the variable named "value" is processed.

#include <iostream>                // for std::cout
#include <cmath>				   // for math functions
using namespace std;               // supports cout

// precondition:  double argument assigned a value
// postcondition: floor, ceil, fabs and sqrt of argument is computed
//                and printed out to standard output
int compute_and_print( double d );

int main( )
{
  double value = 0.0;   // This variable is local to the main function

  cout << "Please enter a value for computations: " << endl;
  cin  >> value;

  compute_and_print( value );
  cout << "After the function call, value=" << value << endl;
  return 0;
}

int compute_and_print( double d ) {
  double value;         // This variable is local to this function
                        // it is NOT the same variable as the "value" variable in main()
  value = floor( d );
  cout << "\t floor_value = " << value << endl;
  value = ceil( d );
  cout << "\t ceil_value  = " << value  << endl;
  value = fabs( d );
  cout << "\t fabs_value  = " << value << endl;
  value = sqrt( d );
  cout << "\t sqrt_value  = " << value  << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

## Exercises

1. What is the effect of calling show(4)?

```c++
int show(int x) {
  cout << x << " " << x*x << endl;
  return x*x;
  cout << x << " " << x*x*x << endl;
  return x*x*x;
}
```

2. What does the following C++ function do?

```c++
int eq3(int a, int b, int c) {
  if ((a == b) && (a == c))
    return 1;
  else
    return 0;
}
```

3. Write a C++ function that takes a real number as an argument and returns the absolute value of that number.

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

float absolute(float n){
  if (n < 0.0){
    return -n;
  } else{
    return n;
  }
}

int main(){
  float abs1 = absolute(5.5);
  float abs2 = absolute(-10.2);
  cout << "5.5 is " << abs1 << " -10.2 is " << abs2 << endl;
}
```

6. Write a C++ function to calculate a total cost of a meal. The function should take in a base cost, the tip percentage as a decimal, and a tax percentage as a decimal. The function should return the total cost of the meal.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

float tip_calculator(float base, float tip_pct, float tax_pct){
  float total = base + base * tip_pct + base * tax_pct;
  return total;
}

int main(){
  float total = tip_calculator(35.6, 0.2, 0.01);
  total = roundf(total * 100) / 100;
  cout << "Total is " << total << endl;
}

```
