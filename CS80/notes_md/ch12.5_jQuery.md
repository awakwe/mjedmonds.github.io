Chapter 12.5: jQuery

CS 80: Internet Programming

### jQuery

-   A lightweight javascript library

-   Main advantage: provides a lot of functionality in a minimal amount
    of code

    -   Works across browsers and platforms

    -   Means you don\'t have to worry about minor differences between
        browsers

-   Makes practical javascript much easier

### Importing jQuery

-   jQuery is hosted by many large companies
:::

### jQuery Basics

-   Conceptual starting points

    -   We will *select* HTML elements and then perform some *action* on
        the elements

    -   Basic syntax:

            $(selector).action()

    -   `$` indicates we are using jQuery

    -   `( selector )` finds corresponding HTML elements

    -   `action()` performs some action on the elements

### Anonymous Functions

-   Anonymous functions are functions without a name

-   We had subtly been using anonymous functions when we assigned
    variables to functions

-   Remember:

        var sum2 = function(a,b){
          return a + b;
        }

### Anonymous Functions

-   Remember:

        var sum2 = function(a,b){
          return a + b;
        }

-   The right hand side of this assignment has no name!

-   We\'ll be seeing this pattern more, don\'t freak out!

### Document Loading

-   Previously, we used the following paradigm to wait until the page is
    ready:

        window.addEventListener("load", start, false);

        function start(){
          // startup code
        }

-   jQuery makes this a lot easier\...

        $( document ).ready(function() {
          // startup code
        }); //notice the syntax of this, we are passing an anonymous function as a parameter! (see the ");" ending the parameter
:::

### Document Loading

-   What does this do?

    -   `$(document)` Selects the document

    -   `.ready()` is a a jQuery event

    -   The anonymous function is the callback to call when the event is
        trigger

    -   Notice how similar this is to what we did before, but with much
        simplier code

        -   We didn\'t have to register a listener for the page loading,
            then define another function for the start of the DOM
            interaction.

        -   jQuery does this in one step!

### jQuery Selectors

-   `*` - select all

-   `#id` - select id `id`

-   `.class` - select CSS class `class`

-   `ele` - select all HTML `ele` elements

-   You can also use comma separated values to select multiple selectors

    -   E.g. `.class1,.class2` will select both `.class1` and `.class2`

-   See: <http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp>

### Exercise

-   How can we achieve the same with jQuery?

-   Hint: you have the `.mouseenter()`, `.mouseleave()`, `.attr()`, and
    `.removeAttr()` jQuery actions

### Exercise

-   But this is not very resuable

-   Why?

    -   We can\'t make `#p1` a variable!

    -   And cannot easily highlight other IDs

-   Fix?

### [Example: `highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html`](../examples/ch12.5_jQuery/highlighting_mouse_anon_func.html)

This is a good example of how to modularize and expand a simple example
into a reusable segment of code

### jQuery Animation

-   jQuery can animate CSS property changes!

-   The property changes must be numerical (e.g. cannot animate
    `background-color: red`)

-   The properties are contained in a set of curly braces like so (this
    data format is called JSON, which we will cover later):

        { css-prop1: value, css-prop2: value } 
:::

::: {.section}
### Exercise

-   Write an animation to change a box\'s hieght and width to 300px when
    the user\'s mouse enters the box. The box should start at 100px by
    100px and return to that size when the mouse leaves
