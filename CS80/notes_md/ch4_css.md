## Chapter 4: CSS

CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## Intro to CSS

- CSS = Cascading Style Sheet
- What does HTML5 do?
  - Specifies the content and structure of the webpage
- So far, we haven't controlled the *presentation* of the webpage at all.
- CSS allows us to control the presentation of the page

## Intro to CSS

- Why not control the presentation within the HTML?
  - You can!
  - But in general, it's better to separate!
    - Why? Because you can swap the style without changing anything in the HTML document

## Inline Style

- Specify the style in the html tag through a `style` attribute
  - E.g. to change the font size, one might apply the attribute `style="font-size: 45pt;"` which would set the font size to 45pt.

## Inline Styles

- Advantage:
  - Styling is applied solely to this instance of the tag (useful if we want custom styling for one particular tag)
- Disadvantage:
  - Styling is applied solely to this instance of the tag (meaning it has no generality; we can't change the style of every tag across the entire document. In our example, we may want to change every `<h2>` in the document

## Example: [`inline_styles.html`](../examples/ch4_css/inline_styles.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/inline_styles.html}
```

## Embedded Style Sheets

- Idea: embed a styling sheet inside the `<head>` tag of the HTML
    document
- Example:

```css
/* css to modify all p tags */
p {
  font-size: x-large;
  font-family: arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Embedded Style Sheets

- What does this do?
  - Changes every `<p>` tag in the document to have an extra large font and use Arial font

## Embedded Style Sheets

- Each property is a key-value pair
  - Key is the property to change (e.g. `font-size`)
  - Value is the setting of the property (e.g. `x-large`)
  - Key and value are always separated by a `:` and the key-value pair is terminated with a `;`

## Embedded Style Sheets

- Advantage:
  - Styling is applied across every instance of an element in the entire document
- Disadvantage:
  - Styling is still restricted to this HTML document; we cannot "export" the embedded style sheet to other HTML documents 

## Example: [`embedded_styles.html`](../examples/ch4_css/embedded_styles.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/embedded_styles.html}
```

## Common CSS Properties

- `font-family`
  - Names the font to use.
  - Typically a comma-separated list. The browser will attempt to use the first font availabe in the list. The final entry in the list should be a generic font, like `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, or `fantasy`
  - Example: `font-family: helvectica, tahoma, sans-serif;`

## Common CSS Properties

- `font-size`
  - Controls the font size of text
  - Can specify size two different ways: through a point value (`NUMBERpt)` or with a relative size
  - Available relative sizes: `xx-small``, x-small, small, smaller, medium, large, ``larger``, x-large, xx-large`)
  - Preferrable to use relative sizes
    - Why? Different computers have different resolutions, so using `pt` will result in different effects based on the user's display
  - Example: `font-size: x-small;`

## Common CSS Properties

- `font-style`
  - Controls the font's additonal styling
  - Possible values: `normal, italic, oblique`
  - Example: `font-style: italic`

## Common CSS Properties

- `background-color`
  - Sets the background color. Takes hexidemial value or rgb
  - Example: `background-color: #668B8B`

## Example: [`background_color.html`](../examples/ch4_css/background_color.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/background_color.html}
```

## Common CSS Properties

- `background-image`
  - Takes a `url('image')` and uses it as the background
  - Can have a list of comma-separated `url()` 's to fetch
  - Example: `background-image: url('http://eskipaper.com/images/sand-dune-pictures-1.jpg')`

## Example: [`background_image.html`](../examples/ch4_css/background_image.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/background_image.html}
```

## Common CSS Properties

- `background-repeat`
  - Specifies whether or not you would like the background to repeat or not
  - By default, background repeats
  - Possible values: `repeat, repreat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat`
    - `repeat` will repeat in both the x and y direction
  - Example: `background-repeat: repeat-x`

## Common CSS Properties

- `background-position`
  - Specifies the background relative to the HTML element.
  - X is offset from the left and Y is offset from the top
  - Takes unit values (like width and height) or `left, right, center,` for X `top, bottom, center` for Y
  - By default, background position is (0,0) relative to the element's position in the document
  - Example: `background-position: center left;`
    - If you only specify one, the other will default to center

## Common CSS Properties

- `background`
  - This is a shorthand way to apply all of the above
  - `background: bg-color bg-image position bg-repeat`

## Common CSS Properties

- `text-align`\
  - `center`, `left`, or `right` to align text\
- CSS property list reference: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference>

## Common CSS-related HTML Tags

- `<div>`
  - Specifies a HTML block element, similar to `<p>`, but doesn't denote a paragraph
  - Starts with a new line and takes up as much width available (stretches to the left and right as much as possible)
    - `<h1>`-`<h6>` and `<p>` are also block elements (consider their
      behavior!)

## Common CSS-related HTML Tags

- `<span>`
  - An inline block
  - Has minimal width and doesn't start a new line
- Why do `<div>` and `<span>` matter?
  - They are commonly used to apply styling to subsections of the document, when no other divisor exists
  - E.g. think of the `<em>some text</em>`as `<span style="font-style: italic;">some text</span>`
    - We may/probably don't have a built-in tag to help us, so `div` and `span` can be a very general way to apply styling to a specific section

## CSS Classes and Selectors

- It's pretty limiting to only be able to use CSS styling on an element-by-element basis
- CSS classes are applied to a tag on a tag-by-tag basis using the `class` attribute
- Advantages:
  - Can use the same class among multiple HTML tags
  - Updating the CSS class will update all tags

## CSS Classes and Selectors

- Usage: all classes start with `.`
- Example:

  ```css
  .myemph { font-style: italic; }
  ```

- Apply this class using the `class` attribute:

  ```html
  <p class="myemph">some_text</p>
  ```

## CSS Classes and Selectors

- We can even apply certain classes only to specific HTML tags
  - This type CSS styling increases the *specifcity* of the styling, which help resolve styling conflicts (more on this in a bit)
- Example:

  ```css
  p.myemph { font-style: italic; }
  ```

  - only defines our `myemph` class for use within a `<p>` HTML tag

## CSS Classes and Selectors

- Selectors are a bit more general (classes are a type of selector)
  - They specify how the CSS rules should be applied
  - A class is a selector rule, but we also have selectors for `id`'s with `#id`
- Example:

  ```css
  #htmlid { color: blue }
  ```

- Corresponding HTML:

  ```html
  <section id="htmlid">
  ```

## CSS Precedence

- ID selection has the highest precedence (e.g. `#id`)
- Followed by tag-specific classes (e.g. `p.myemph`)
- Followed by classes (e.g. `myemph`)
- Followed by HTML tag rules (e.g. `p`)

## Conflicting Styles

- What does *Cascading* mean?
  - "falling through"
- So far, we've seen rules will maintain their presence in nested children until something overwrites their value (consider [`background_color.html`](../examples/ch4_css/background_color.html))

## Conflicting Styles

- But what's the actual logic here?
  - Children of HTML elements inherit the CSS styling of their parents
  - Children style's have a higher precendence over their parents, so their styling will always replace their parents (if applicable)

## Conflicting Styles

- Let's try a weird scenario:
  - We defined a `myemph` both as a CSS class and a CSS class for `<p>`
  - So what happens when we write a normal `<p>` (no class specified) inside of a `<div class="myemph">`?

## Example: [`conflicting_styles.html`](../examples/ch4_css/conflicting_styles.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/conflicting_styles.html}
```

## Conflicting Styles

- There are other ways to generate conflicts (such as [`background_color.html`](../examples/ch4_css/background_color.html) using normal nesting)
- But the general rule: the most specific styling takes precedence

## External Style Sheets

- Idea: store the style sheet elsewhere and import it into the HTML document
- Advantages:
  - We can use the same styling across multiple HTML documents
  - If they all import the same external style sheet, they will all adhere to the same styling rules
  - If we change the stylesheet once, it will affect all documents that link to it!
- The `<link>` HTML tag is used to import external styling

## External Style Sheets

- Attributes required:
  - `rel="stylesheet"` specifies the relationship between this document and the external one, in this case, we want to link to a stylesheet
  - `type="text/css"` just like how we specified with `<style type="text/css">`\
  - `href="style.css"` is the hyperlink reference to the external document\
- Example:

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  ```

## Example: [`external_styles.html`](../examples/ch4_css/external_styles.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/external_styles.html}
```

## CSS Comments

```css
/* This is a CSS comment. start with /* and end with */ */
```

## CSS Units

- Used to control sizing
  - `#em` amount relative to the normal size\
  - `#cm` amount in centimeters\
  - `#px` amount in pixels\
  - `#pt` amount in points
  - Keep these in mind when looking at CSS

## CSS Positioning

- `position` property controls the location of document elements\
  - Basic idea: answers the question: where should this element be relative to other elements?

## CSS Positioning

`position` property

- Corresponding attributes: `left: value;` and `top: value;` which control the amount of positioning to apply
  - "left" corresponds to how much to move from left
  - "top" corresponds to how much to move from the top
  - See: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_left.asp> for values
  - Keep these mind when considering the various positioning types

## CSS Positioning

Absolute positioning

- `position: absolute;` sepcifies this elements position **relative to it's first positioned (not static) ancestor element**\
  - "Ancestor" refers to the parents of this HTML element (nesting establishes parent-child relationships) 

## CSS Positioning

Relative positioning

- `position: relative;` specifies the element's position **relative to its normal positioning**\
  - So if we move 5px from the left and 10px from the top, the element is positioned right 5px and down 10px

## CSS Positioning

Fixed positioning

- `position: fixed;` specifies the element's position **relative to the browser window**

## CSS Positioning

Static positioning

- `position: static;` the default behavior, positioning is determined by document flow/ordering
- Property values: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp>

## Example: [`positioning.html`](../examples/ch4_css/positioning.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/positioning.html}
```

## Element Dimensions

- These allow us to specify the actual dimensions of each page element.
- Benefits: helps control the size of elements, which can be useful for positioning
- Two main properties:
  - `width: value;` to specify width
  - `height: value;` to specify height

## Element Dimensions

- `overflow` property defines what to do if the content of an element goes over the specified dimensions
  - Possible values:
    - `overflow: visible;` overflow will still be rendered (overflowing into over elements)
    - `overflow: hidden;` overflow will be clipped (overflowing content will be invisible)
    - `overflow: scroll;` scroll bars are used to view the rest of the content
    - `overflow: auto;` if the overflow is clipped, a scroll bar will appear

## Example: [`positioning.html`](../examples/ch4_css/positioning.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/positioning.html}
```

## The Box Model

- We've loosely discussed the notion of boxes with html elements (like `p, div, h1-h6, section`), but let's formalize it
- Key terms:
  - **Content**: the area the actual content makes up
  - **Padding**: area between the content and the border
  - **Margin**: area between the border and other elements

## The Box Model

![The box model](images/css-box-model.png)

## The Box Model

- **A critical note:** border defines the "end" of the element box in some sense
  - Margin is a means to enforce a **minimum distance between two elements' borders**
  - **READ THE LAST SENTENCE CAREFULLY**
- What this means: margins **do not sum**
  - Think of it as a "max" (which ever element has the largest margin will be enforcing the margin)

## The Box Model

- Quiz:
  - If you have an element with a margin of 5 pixels next to an element with a margin of 10 pixels, what will be the number of pixels **between the borders?** (this is the effective margin)
  - If you have an element with a margin of 500 pixels next to an element with a margin of 10 pixels, what will be the number of pixels **between the borders?** (this is the effective margin)

## The Box Model

Controlling borders

- `border-width` property\
  - <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-width.asp>\
- `border-style` property\
  - <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp>\
- `border-color` property\
  - <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-color.asp>
- Shorthand: `border: width style color;`

## Example: [`box_model.html`](../examples/ch4_css/box_model.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/box_model.html}
```

## Floating Elements

- Allows you to move an element to one side of the screen while other content flows around it
- This "breaks" our notion of block elements (such as `p, div, section, h1-h6`) to fill the width of the screen.
- When used with element dimensions, page layout becomes very controllable

## Floating Elements

- Three property values:
  - `float: none;` default, element is not floated\
  - `float: right;` element is floated to the right. Other content can flow on the left side\
  - `float: left;` element is floated to the left. Other content can flow on the right side\

## Floating Elements

- `clear` allows you to specify that an element should not flow with a float (e.g. will not flow with an element on right/left; it will start below the floated element)\
  - `clear: left;` do not allow floating to the left\
  - `clear: right;` do not allow floating to the right\
  - `clear: both;` do not allow floating to the light or right\

## Example: [`floating.html`](../examples/ch4_css/floating.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/floating.html}
```

## Margin and Padding

- `margin` property specifies the required space between the border and the next element (see box model above)\
- Value is a length (px, pt, cm, etc) or a % of the page
- The `margin` attribute is shorthand for `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`
  - See <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp> for margin variations
- Example: `margin: 50px 40px 100px 25px` (what does this mean?)
- Example: `margin-top: 100px`

## Margin and Padding

- `padding` property specifies the amount of space between the content and the border (see box model above)\
  - Value is a length (px, pt, cm, etc) or a % of the page
  - The `padding` attribute is shorthand for `padding-top`, `padding``-right`, `padding``-bottom`, `padding-left`
    - See <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp> for padding variations\
  - Example: `padding: 50px 40px 100px 25px` (what does this mean?)
  - Example: `padding-top: 100px`
- See: `media_types_queries.html` or `positioning.html`

## Media Types and Media Queries

Media Types

- Allow you to specify what the page should look like on different  media.
- Standarad media type is `screen`, which stands for computer screen
- Other options: `handheld` (cell phone/mobile), `speech` (read out old), `print` (printers).
- Basic example:

  ```css
  /* media query example */
  @media all {
    body { background-color: black; }
  }
  @media print{
    body { background-color: white; }
  }
  ```

## Media Types and Media Queries

Media Queries

- Allow you to query the user's device and use different CSS rules based on the media 
  - `height` - height of display area (the browser) 
  - `width` - width of display area (the browser)
  - `resolution` - resolution of the output device
  - `orientation` - landscape or portrait

## Media Types and Media Queries

Media Queries

- CSS Syntax

  ```css
  /* media query syntax */
  @media not|only mediatype and (media feature) {
    CSS-Code;
  }
  ```

- `not` negates the media query\
- `only` applies the style only if the query matches\
- Note: you may omit the `mediatype` and only specify a `(media feature)` if you wish

## Example: [`media_types_queries.html`](../examples/ch4_css/media_types_queries.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/media_types_queries.html}
```

## Drop-Down Menus

- Excellent way to control navigation panes without using screen space
- Utilized through the `display` property:
  - Controls how the element is displayed; e.g. `block` (like `p`, `section` etc) or `inline` (like `span`, `em` etc)
  - `display: none;` element is not displayed
  - `display: block;` displays a block level element
  - `display: inline;` displays as an inline element
  - `display: inline-block;` display is like an inline element, but can have a specified height and width

## Example: [`drop_down_menu.html`](../examples/ch4_css/drop_down_menu.html)

```{include=../examples/ch4_css/drop_down_menu.html}
```
