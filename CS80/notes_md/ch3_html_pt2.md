## Chapter 3: Introduction to HTML Part 2

CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## HTML5 Forms

HTML5 introduces new input types for forms

- These input types are self-validating
  - No need for javascript validation!
- However, the input data should be verified server-side

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- Each is part of a `<input type="type">` tag
- `color`: allows user to input a RGB, many browsers have color picker.
  - Input must be a hexadecimal value (color code)
- `date`: calendar date input, many browsers have a calendar-style picker

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `datetime`: date and time input
  - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm+ff in UTC (English time)
- `datetime-local`:  date and time input
  - yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm+ff

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `email`: email input
  - address\@domain.com

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `month`: month input
  - yyyy-mm
- `number`: any number input
  - min and max attributes set the min and max possible valid values

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `range`: range slider between particular values - no validation required
  - min and max attributes set the min and max possible values
  - all values are valid

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `search`: search field, behaves like a text input
- `tel`: telephone number input, **HTML5 does not validate this input!**

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `time`: time input
  - hh:mm
- `url`: valid URL input
  - [http://domain.com](http://domain.com/)

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form input types

- `week: `input a specific week (nn is a week number, between 01 and 53
  - yyyy-Wnn
- If a browser does not support the specified input type, the type will be treated as \"text\".
  - Means you must *always* validate server-side!

## Example: [`new_forms.html`](../examples/ch3_html_pt2/new_forms.html)

```{include=../examples/ch3_html_pt2/new_forms.html}
```

## Input Focusing

Input `tabindex` attribute

- `tabindex` attribute enables controlling the order of input focus on TAB
- Ordering starts at 1

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `autofocus:` applied to input tag, automatically gives focus to this element (e.g. user can type immediately)
  - Can only be used on one input element per document

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `formnovalidate`: applied to input tag, allows a form to bypass validation
  - Must be applied to an input type
  - Means you must validate server side!!
- `novalidate:` applied to the form tag, allows a form to bypass validation
  - Means you must validate server side!!

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `placeholder`: applied to input tag, temporary text in an input field
  - Typically either the format of the input, or an example
  - Only applies to the following input types:
    - `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `required:` applied to input tag, requires the user to input the form element
  - Form cannot be submitted until they do
  - this is overridden by formnovalidate or novalidate

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `pattern:` applied to input tag, requires the input match the specified regular expression

## Regular Expressions

A regular what?

- What\'s a regular expression (regex)?
  - A pattern matching tool
  - Text is described through a pattern, rather than a full description outlining every character

## Regular Expressions

Telephone pattern explained

- Pattern:

  ```regex
  \(\d{3}\) +\d{3}-\d{4}
  ```

- Prelimnary note: `\` in regex is similar to `&` in HTML
  - `/` escapes the special character
    - Escaping means stripping it of its special meaning

## Regular Expressions

Telephone pattern explained

- Pattern:

  ```regex
  \(\d{3}\) +\d{3}-\d{4}
  ```

- `(` has a special meaning in regex, namely to start saving the matched pattern to a *group* (saving a section of the pattern for later use)
- `)` marks the end of the saved group
- You can then reference the group later with `\#` where `#` is the group number used in the expression you wish to reference
  - E.g. to reference the first saved group, use `\1`
- Because of this special meaning, we have to escape it

## Regular Expressions

Telephone pattern explained

- Pattern:

  ```regex
  \(\d{3}\) +\d{3}-\d{4}
  ```

- `\d` says we want to look for a digit (\[0-9\])
  - In this case, the escape gives `d` a special meaning - namely a digit
- `{3}` says we want to look for the previous pattern 3 times (3 digits)

## Regular Expressions

Telephone pattern explained

- Pattern:

  ```regex
  \(\d{3}\) +\d{3}-\d{4}
  ```

- \"` `\" is a literal space to look for
  - `+` means match the previous pattern 1 or more times
- Then, we look for 3 more digits, followed by a `-` then 4 more digits

## HTML5 Forms

New HTML5 form attributes

- `autocomplete`: added to form or input tag, allows user to use previously submitted information when returning to the same form
  - You can turn autocomplete on or off for specific elements, overriding a value already set
  - Allows you to protect sensitive information from being autocomplete candidates
    - E.g. password, credit card info, etc.

## `datalist` element

- Provides input options for a text form input
- As the user starts typing, the list will narrow
  - How the list narrows depends on the browser
- The datalist must be connected to an input through the `id` attribute
  - This is the glue between the list and the corresponding form input
  - Also means one list can be used on multiple form inputs

## Example: [`adv_new_forms.html`](../examples/ch3_html_pt2/adv_new_forms.html)

```{include=../examples/ch3_html_pt2/adv_new_forms.html}
```

## Example: [`fig3_17.html`](../examples/ch3_html_pt2/fig3_17.html)

```{include=../examples/ch3_html_pt2/fig3_17.html}
```

## Page structure elements

- `header`: used to specify the header of the webpage, but can actually be included multiple times
  - Used to give introductory content or navigational links
- `footer`: used to specify the footer of the webpage, but can actually be included multiple times
  - Used to give authorship information, copyright, contact, sitemap, etc

## Page structure elements

- `time:` used to identify a date, a time, or both
- `nav:` used to group navigational links
  - Do not place all links in the nav element, only the navigational ones (could be in the header or the footer typically)
- `figure:` describes a figure, used to group a `figcaption` and the `img` tag
- `figcaption:` provides a caption for the corresponding figure

## Page structure elements

- `article`: specifies independent, self-contained content
  - Can be nested
  - Intended for forum posts, blog posts, news story, commentary, etc
- `details:` provides information about a specific topic
- `summary:` displays summary of content inside of a `details` tag
  - The details of the summary are contained in a `details `tag

## Page structure elements

- `section:` provides a section-based structure to a page; similar to
- `article`, but more general
  - Can be nested
  - Used frequently with `id` attributes for internal linking
  - Typically also comes with a header of some kind
- `aside:` describes content related to something, but not critical
  - Could be background history or related information

## Page structure elements

- `meter`: shows an amount
  - Similar to a `range` (but is not input), or a loading bar (but does not animate)
- `mark: `highlight enclosed text
- `wbr:` controls when to break a word when text wrapping to the next line
  - Would this require a closing tag?

## Example: [`new_elements.html`](../examples/ch3_html_pt2/new_elements.html)

```{include=../examples/ch3_html_pt2/new_elements.html}
```

## Tools in a Toolbox

Remember, these are general guidelines. HTML is a like a toolbox; you
are free to use them as you see fit.

A hammer is better at nailing than a saw. In general, it\'s best to
stick to the convention.

## Advanced HTML5

Video

- `controls` attribute (no arguments/assignment) allows you to add video control buttons, such as play, pause, volume
- `height `and `width` can be added to control the size of the video
- `muted `will start the video initially muted
- `loop` will determine whether or not the video should loop after finishing

## Advanced HTML5

Video

- `autoplay `will start the video as soon as it loads
- The `video` tag is dissimilar from the `img` tag
  - You can use the video tag as a void tag (like an `img` tag) or you can specify multiple `source` tags
  - `source` tags specify a video file and a type
    - A `video` tag can have multiple `source` tags; the browser will play the first type supported.
    - If no types are supported, the text in between the `video` tag will be displayed.

## Advanced HTML5

Audio

- Extremely similar to playing video
  - Only difference with video is no `height` and `width` attribute
  - `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted` are all the same
  - Must specify an audio file (like MP3) instead of video

## Example: [`audio.html`](../examples/ch3_html_pt2/audio.html)

```{include=../examples/ch3_html_pt2/audio.html}
```

## Advanced HTML5

Canvas

- `canvas:` allows you to draw 2D and 3D drawings on the screen
    - This requires javascript, so just hold on, we will go over this later!
