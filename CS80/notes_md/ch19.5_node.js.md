CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

### Overview

-   Node (node.js) enables server-side JavaScript
-   Much of what we did with PHP can be done with node.js
-   Node has much more functionality than PHP; you can basically write
    whatever JavaScript program you want without needing to execute in a
    browser
:::

### Overview

-   Node is designed to make it easy to write I/O-based programs that
    run of a server
-   I/O-based programs include web servers, databases, etc.

### Overview

-   Node uses event-based asynchronous processing
-   We will use same event-listener and callbacks we learned in
    JavaScript
:::

### Installing Node

-   Node can be installed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   Node is a command-line program, and you start node with by typing
    `node` at your terminal/command prompt

### Hello, world!

-   Save the following in `hello_world.js`
-   Launch the program with

### Modules

-   We wrote `var http = require("http");` in the HTTP server example
-   http is a module that our node application requires
-   But we also want to write our own models
-   This is accomplished using `exports`

### [Example: `index.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/index.js)

### Modules

-   Modules are a core component of node.js
-   They allow you to modularize code
-   This breaks our I/O-based application easier to manage and scalable
-   Each module can be responsible for a specific kind of I/O
:::

::: {.section}
### Routing

-   So far, every HTTP resquest was handled the same way
-   Routing allows us to specify which modules process certain HTTP
    requests
-   We\'ll look at the URL and the data in the GET/POST parameters and
    make a decision about where this HTTP request should be routed.
