## Chapter 19.5: node.js

CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## Overview

- Node (node.js) enables server-side JavaScript
- Not a programming language, but rather a server-side application that allows you to program server-side applications in JavaScript
- Much of what we did with PHP can be done with node.js
- Node has much more functionality than PHP; you can basically write whatever JavaScript program you want without needing to execute in a browser

## Overview

- Node is designed to make it easy to write I/O-based programs that run of a server
- I/O-based programs include web servers, databases, etc.

## Overview

- Node uses event-based asynchronous processing
- We will use same event-listener and callbacks we learned in JavaScript

## Installing Node

- Node can be installed from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Node is a command-line program, and you start node with by typing `node` at your terminal/command prompt

## Hello, world!

- Save the following in `hello_world.js`

  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  ```

- Launch the program with

  ```shell
  node hello_world.js
  ```

## Example: [`http_server.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server.js}
```

## Modules

- We wrote `var http = require("http");` in the HTTP server example
- http is a module that our node application requires
- But we also want to write our own models
- This is accomplished using `exports`

## Example: [`http_server_export.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server_export.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server_export.js}
```

## Example: [`index.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/index.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/index.js}
```

## Modules

- Modules are a core component of node.js
- They allow you to modularize code
- This breaks our I/O-based application easier to manage and scalable
- Each module can be responsible for a specific kind of I/O

## Routing

- So far, every HTTP resquest was handled the same way
- Routing allows us to specify which modules process certain HTTP requests
- We\'ll look at the URL and the data in the GET/POST parameters and make a decision about where this HTTP request should be routed.

## Example: [`router.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/router.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/router.js}
```

## Example: [`http_server_router.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server_router.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/http_server_router.js}
```

## Example: [`index_router.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/index_router.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/index_router.js}
```

## Fileserver

- But we actually want our webserver to *do* something.
- Let's write a basic webserver, capable of serving files to the client (similar to our Python SimpleHTTPServer we used earlier)

## Example: [`http_fileserver.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/http_fileserver.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/http_fileserver.js}
```

## Example: [`index_fileserver.js`](../examples/ch19.5_node/index_fileserver.js)

```{include=../examples/ch19.5_node/index_fileserver.js}
```
