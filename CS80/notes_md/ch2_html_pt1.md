## Chapter 2: Introduction to HTML Part 1

CS 80: Internet Programming

Instructor: Mark Edmonds

## HTML

- What does it stand for?
  - Hypertext markup language

- What is a markup language?
  - Not a traditional programming language
  - Specifies the structure and content of documents

## Editing HTML

- All you need is a text editor and a web browser
- Text editors
  - Brackets (recommended), Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, TextEdit, Vim (!), etc
  - Anything will do, but don\'t use Microsoft Word (technically you can do this but it will make for a painful semester and you will almost certainly get points off)

## Editing HTML

- Web browsers
- Chrome, firefox, IE, etc
- For this course, firefox seems to be the most agreeable
  - There is one assignment with Ajax that only works with firefox

## HTML Concepts

- Documents are composed of HTML5 *tags*
- These tags outline this structure and content of a webpage
- Tag format:
  - `<tag>` begins the tag
  - `</tag>` closes the tag

## HTML Concepts

- Most tags have a beginning and an end
  - Exceptions: `<meta>` (specifies document metadata, `<img>` tag (adds an image to the page), there are others we will come across
  - We call tags without an ending *void elements* because they do not markup text (text is not placed between a start and an end tag).

## HTML Concepts

- Tags can be *nested* e.g. there is a tag inside of another tag before the outer tag\'s closing tag
- Attributes: content inside of a tag that specifies information about this particular use of the tag
- We will see an example in a moment
- Elements: the portions of a HTML document
  - The beginning to closing of a tag form an element
  - e.g. `<tag>` content `</tag>` is an element

## [Example: `hello_world.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/hello_world.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/hello_world.html}
```

## HTML5 Validation

- You can validate HTML online!
- Go to <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload> to validate a file
- Go to <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input> to validate input
- Upload `hello_world.html` example to validator

## Headings

- Heading elements designate a level of importance for a topic on a page
- Headings range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`
  - The lower the number, the greater importance
  - `<h1>` is the \"most\" important

## Example: [`headings.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/headings.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/headings.html}
```

## Hyperlinks

- Provides a link to another HTML document
- Can be on this host or on a different host
  - What does this mean?
  - You can link internally to your own content or to a new host\'s webpage.
  - In either case, a new HTTP request is triggered

## Hyperlinks

- Links are facilitated using the `<a>` tag with a corresponding attribute of `href`
  - `a` stands for \'anchor\'
  - `href` stands for \'hypertext reference\'
- We can href other protocols (e.g. `https://`, `ftp://`, `mailto:`, `file:`, etc) or even javascript!
  - If it\'s javascript the script will execute when clicked
  - This will make more sense once we get to javascript, hold on!

## Example: [`linking.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/linking.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/linking.html}
```

## Images

- Added to HTML using the `<img>` tag
- `<img>` tag is one of the tags without an ending `</img>`
- The `src` attribute specifies where the image is located
  - The location can be a relative path (e.g. stored on the same computer as the html document)
  - The location can be a remote path (e.g. an image stored on a different host)

## Images

- Must use an `alt` attribute, it is allows for two important usages:
  - For those with poor or no eyesight to still understand the content on the page. A text-to-speech program can read the `alt` description to a visually impaired person.
  - If the image fails to load (maybe it\'s an external image), the `alt` can still describe what the image is
  - The `alt` description should be as brief as possible while still being descriptive

## Images

- Common attributes used: specifying height and width\'
  - Height and width are both measured in pixels
  - If there are no height and width are specified, image will be rendered at it\'s own size (the original image size)
- Images can be nested inside of a link tag (`<a>`) to create an image that is also a hyperlink

## Example: [`images.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/images.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/images.html}
```

## Special Characters

- HTML itself uses certain characters to represent the structure of the document
- These symbols have special meaning within the document itself
- What are some examples?
- How are tags wrapped?
  - Around `<` and `>`

## Special Characters

- Clearly, we still want to be able to include these tags in an HTML document.
- Solution: We have to use a special convention to include these restricted characters
- These special conventions are called *character entity references*
- The basic format: `&ref;`
  - Where `ref` is a reference to the character you wish to insert

## Special Characters

- E.g. `&lt;` inserts the less-than symbol (\<)
- You can find a list of these symbols online
  - Do a quick google search go all of the symbols available
  - <http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp>
  - <https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html>

## Example: [`char.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/char.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/char.html}
```

## Lists

- Two types of lists:
  - Unordered list and ordered list
- Unordered list (bulleted list; like this list)
  - `ul` tag starts an unordered list (`ul` stands for unordered list)
  - Each list item is a nested `li` tag (`li` stands for list element)

## Lists

- Ordered list (numbered list)
  - `ol` tag starts an ordered list
  - each list item is a nested `li` tag
- We can also make lists inside of lists (nested lists)
  - Just like your word processor
  - Bullets of an unordered list will change based on the nesting level

## Example: [`lists.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/lists.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/lists.html}
```

## Line Breaks

- `<br>` tag - a line break

## Tables

- Similar to a textbook table or excel spreadsheet (except without math functions)
- Started with the `table` tag
- The nested `caption` tag gives the table a title and summarizes the table\'s content

## Tables

Table Bodies, Headers, and Footers

- `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` specify the header and footer of the table, respectively
  - Maybe you want different styling for the header and footer using CSS
  - Again, we\'ll cover that later

## Tables

Table Bodies, Headers, and Footers

- `<tbody>` specifies the main body portion of the table
- `<thead>` and `<tfoot>` have the same internal structure

## Tables

Table Rows

- `<tbody>`, `<thead>`, and `<tfoot>` is comprised of at least one `<tr>` element, which is a table row 
  - Note that no table requires all three, but you should use them appropriately
- If your table has a header, put the header, etc.
- Makes table maintenance easier later

## Tables

Table Rows

- Each `<tr>` tag is comprised of `<th>` tags, which is a *header cell*.
  - It is different from the normal cell.
  - It is different to allow easier styling using CSS
  - The table fills left to right along the columns
- Repeat this `<tr>` and `<th>` pattern for each row, and each column you want to specify
- `<tfoot>` can be below or above 

## Tables

Table Rows

- `<tbody>` follows the same convention, but uses a `<td>` element instead of `<th>`
- `td` stands for \'table data\'

## Tables

Table Sizing

- By default, each table column is only as wide as its largest cell.
- `rowspan` and `colspan`
- These attributes allows a cell to span multiple rows or columns
  - This is like merging rows/columns in a document

## Tables

Table Sizing

- `rowspan` allows a single table cell to span the width of more than
    one cell or row
- `colspan` allows a single table cell to span the width of more than
    one cell or column
- These attributes can be applied in `<th>` and `<td>` elements

## [Example: `tables.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/tables.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/tables.html}
```

## Forms

- Mechanism for the user to send data to the server from the client
- The user types in the data, then hits \'submit\' the submit triggers a
- HTTP request to the server to accept the form
  - The receiving end will be covered in Chapter 17
- Forms use the `<form>` tag

## Forms

Important `<form>` attributes

- These setup the form and specify how and where to send data to the server
- `method` attribute can be two values:
  - `get`
  - `post`

## Forms

Important `<form>` attributes

- `get`
  - Appends form data to url in name/value pairs
  - Length of URL is limited (\~3000 characters limit)
  - Never use this to send sensitive data
  - Best suited for things like a query or other non-secure data (you can bookmark the url to effectively save the form submission)

## Forms

Important `<form>` attributes

- `post`
  - Appends form data to HTTP request
  - Has no size limitations
  - Cannot be bookmarked (since it does not modify the URL)

## Forms

Important `<form>` attributes

- `action`
  - Specifies where to send the form data (*e.g.* what site should process the form)
  - Must be a valid URL
  - The server **should** know how to respond to the form submission

## Forms

Inputs

- Once we have the form setup, we can add inputs
- Inputs are added using the `<input>` tag

## Forms

Important `<input>` attributes

- `type`
  - Controls the type of the input; a lot of options available
  - Options include: `text`, `button`, `color`, `password`, `radio`, `range`, `reset`, `submit`, etc. with more available online

## Forms

Important `<input>` attributes

- `type`
- `hidden` is a special type
  - It submits data to the server that is predetermined in the HTML page
  - The user cannot control this input
  - Might be used for sending information to another server to identify where the form is coming from

## Forms

Important `<input>` attributes

- `type`
- `text` has a couple of special attributes: `size` - specifies the size of the text box and `maxlength` which specifies the maximum length of the input


## Forms

Important `<input>` attributes

- `name`
  - Gives the input a name that can be referenced once the server receives the submission
  - This is part of the glue between the client and the server that processes the form

## Forms

Important `<input>` attributes

- `value`
  - Gives the input an initial value

## Forms

- Please lookup these elements in your book or online:
  - `textarea` - multiline text input, has rows and cols attributes
  - `password` - provides a password-protected field. this is only
      visually enforced (displays a \* instead of the text), the password
      still should be encrypted when sent over HTTP
  - `color` - allows color input
  - `number` - allows user to input a number, similar to a text but for
      numbers
  - `range` - allows user to pick between a range of values
  - `checkbox` - allows user to tick multiple options
  - `radio` - allows user to pick one option from a list
  - They all follow a similar pattern, but familiarize yourself!
- `<select>` tag presents a dropdown menu with a preselected list of options

## [Example: `forms.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/forms.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/forms.html}
```

## Internal Linking

- Mechanism to jump between locations in a single document without reloading the HTML page
- Basic idea: we uniquely mark elements in the document using the `id` attribute, then we refer to the corresponding id in an anchor (a link, the `a` tag)
- The link tag can reference a specific tag in a different HTML document, even on a different host

## Example: [`internal_linking.html`](../examples/ch2_html_pt1/internal_linking.html)

```{include=../examples/ch2_html_pt1/internal_linking.html}
```
