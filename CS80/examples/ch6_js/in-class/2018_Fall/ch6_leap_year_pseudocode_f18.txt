Write a program that determines if the inputted year is a leap year:
    Every year that is divisble by 4, except for years divisble by 100, but including years that are divisible by 400
First step: come up with an algorithm to check

// pseudocode 1
Get leap_year from user
if leap_year is divisible by 4
  if leap_year is divisible by 100
    if leap_year is divisible by 400
      is_leap_year is true
    else
      is_leap_year is false
  else
    is_leap_year is true
else
  is_leap_year is false
  
// pseudocode 2
Get leap_year from user
if leap_year is divisible by 400
  is_leap_year is true
else if leap_year is divisible by 100
  is_leap_year is false
else if leap_year is divisible by 4
  is_leap_year is true
else
  is_leap_year is false
  
// pseudocode 3
Get leap_year from user
is_year_leap is false
if leap_year is divisible by 400
  is_leap_year is true
else if leap_year is divisible by 4 and leap_year is not divisible by 100
  is_leap_year is true

// pseudocode 4
Get leap_year from user
is_year_leap is false
if leap_year is divisible by 400 or (leap_year is divisible by 4 and leap_year is not divisible by 100)
  is_leap_year is true
