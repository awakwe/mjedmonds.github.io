  <h1>Codeboard Submission</h1>
  <p>For this week’s assignments and onward, we will be using 
  <a href="https://codeboard.io" class="uri">
  https://codeboard.io</a>for homework submissions. This will make
  submitting homework easier for a number of reasons:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>You can now verify your grade before the deadline. When you
    hit “Submit” on Codeboard, a testing framework will execute and
    check the output of your program. This makes it easier to get
    full points, as you know in advance which cases your program
    does not handle correctly.</li>
    <li>Online IDE means you can work anywhere with an internet
    connection. There’s no more zipping of files, Visual Studio, or
    XCode projects to setup. I will provide you with starter code,
    and then you go from there. You hit Submit, and you’ve
    submitted your assignment.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>See an demo video of Codeboard here:

  <p>Some notes about Codeboard:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>You are free to continue to use Visual studio or XCode if
    you wish. However, all grading will occur on Codeboard, so you
    are required to submit and pass the test cases on
    Codeboard.</li>
    <li>You 
    <strong>must</strong>save your work under the “
    <em>Project -&gt; Save changes</em>” menu item. 
    <strong>Changes do not save automatically</strong>. 
    <strong>Changes will not save unless you save signed up and
    logged into your Codeboard account</strong>(you can tell
    whether or not you are signed in the bottom left corner). Your
    browser should warn you if you attempt to close the tab/page
    without saving. 
    <strong>Pay attention</strong>.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>Please make an account and use your SMC username as
    your codeboard account username (remove all spaces,
    underscores, and hyphens)</strong>. If I cannot identify who’s
    account belongs to who, you will get a 0 until the problem is
    fixed.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions of each assignment. The output
    restrictions/expectations for test cases is very rigid. A
    single misplaced character will result in failing a test case
    (or all).</li>
    <li>When you submit your assignment, your output may look odd.
    The only thing you need to pay attention to is the green or red
    test case output. The testing framework modifies text
    input/output (so I can compare against correct answers), so it
    changes how the input/output appears.</li>
    <li>The following naming conventions are reserved for the
    testing framework. Should you not adhere to these rules, you
    may get a compilation error. You are 
    <strong>not</strong>permitted to name any function or data
    member (struct, enum, etc) according to the following:
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
      <code>main()</code>- the testing framework defines 
      <code>main()</code>for you. Your main is called 
      <code>user_main()</code></li>
      <li>Any function or data type starting with the name 
      <code>reserved_</code>. For instance, 
      <code>reserved_test()</code>is not permitted for use. These
      are reserved for the testing framework.</li>
    </ol></li>
  </ol>
  <p>This tool is meant to make your life easier, and I think
  you’ll find it very useful in securing a good grade. Please do
  not hesitate with questions, comments, or concerns.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>My score is -1, why?</strong>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>The first possibility is that your program has more
          inputs than expected by the testing framework. For
          instance, you may have added an unexpected loop (the
          description will be clear if a loop is needed), or you
          may prompt for an additional value. If your program has
          an extra input, the codeboard submission will never
          finish and eventually time out, leading to a -1</li>
          <li>Second, less likely possibility: there’s a problem
          with the testing framework. If you are confident you have
          matched the number of inputs in the description, please
          reach out if you believe there is a problem. A -1 grade
          is a common indicator something isn’t configured properly
          between codeboard and Canvas.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The professor sent a note that the testing framework in
      codeboard was updated. How can I get the latest version?
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Save all of your files locally. Copy the contents of
        all of your .cpp and .h to your local machine.</li>
        <li>We’re going to reset your codeboard project. When you
        launch the assignment, you should see a prompt about
        “keeping your version” vs.&#160;“using the original.” Pick
        use the original. This will reset your codeboard project to
        the latest version.</li>
        <li>Recreate all of your files and paste in the
        source.</li>
        <li>Run the tests again with the latest version!</li>
      </ol></li>
