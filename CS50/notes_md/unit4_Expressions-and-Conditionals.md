# Expressions & Conditionals

## Operators

* C has many built-in operators
* We discussed the basic operators in the previous unit, but here will review and expand on those operators
* Basic operators include:
  * `+` addition
  * `-` subtraction
  * `*` multiplication
  * `/` division (floating point and integer division depending upon type)
  * `%` modulo (remainder division)

### Increment and decrement

* Adding 1 to a variable is so common, we have a custom operator for it
* We have three methods of incrementing (the same is true for decrement) variables in C
* Using addition (not technically an increment operator):

```c
a = a + 1; //
```

* Using the prefix increment operator

```c
++a;
```

* Using the postfix increment operator

```c
a++;
```

* What's the difference between these two statements?
  * A lot of the time, there is no difference in practice
  * **HOWEVER**
  * The semantics are technically different
  * How are they different?
    * `++a` increments `a` and then returns the value of `a` (meaning the value returned has already been incremented)
    * `a++` returns the value of `a` and then increments `a` (meaning the value returned has _not_ yet been incremented)
  * When does this matter?
    * Two cases:

```c
int a = 5;
int b = 5;
int c = ++a; // c has the value of 6 after this executes, a has the value of 6
int d = a++; // d has the value of 5 after this executes, a has the value of 6
```

* All of the above also applies for the decrement operator `--`, which subtracts 1 from a variable instead of adding one

### Relational and Equality Operators

* Relational and equality operators return boolean values (boolean meaning true or false)
* Relational operators
  * `<` less than
  * `>` greater than
  * `<=` less than or equal to
  * `>=` greater than or equal to
* Equality operators
  * `==` equals
  * `!=` not equals

### Unary Operators

* Unary means it only acts on a single variable (whereas so far other operators have acted on two variables/values)
* Unary operators
  * `&` address-of (gets the memory address of a variable)
  * `*` contents-of (gets the contents stored in a memory address)
  * `-` negation
  * `+` plus
  * `!` logical negation
  * `(type)` type casting
    * _Type casting_ allows us to convert one variable type into another type
    * Notice that this does **not** round, it truncates
    * For instance, common use is to typecase a floating point number into an integer:

```c
int b = (int)3.5; // 3.5 will be truncated to 3
```

### Logical Operators

* `!` logical negation
* `&&` logical AND
* `||` logical OR

### Precedence

* 1 (highest)
  * `++`/`--`Postfix increment and decrement
  * `()`Function calls
  * `[]` Array subscripting
  * `.` structure/union access
  * `->` structure/union member access through pointer
* 2 (second highest)
  * `++`/`--` Prefix increment and decrement
  * `+`/`-` unary plus and minus
  * `!` logical not
  * `(type)` type casting
  * `*` dereference
  * `&` address-of
* 3 (third highest)
  * `*` multiplication
  * `/` division
  * `%` remainder division
* 4 (forth highest)
  * `+` addition
  * `-` subtraction
* 5 (fifth highest)
  * `<` less than
  * `>` greater than
  * `<=` less than or equal to
  * `>=` greater than or equal to
* 6 (sixth highest)
  * `==` equal
  * `!=` not equal
* 7 (seventh highest)
  * `&&` logical AND
* 8 (eighth highest)
  * `||` logical OR
* 9 (ninth highest)
  * `?:` ternary conditional
* 10 (tenth highest)
  * `=` assignment (and all other forms of assignment, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)
* 11 (eleventh highest)
  * `,` comma (for creating multiple variables)

## calculations.c

```c
/*
   Let's try writing some calculations...
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   float value1 = 0.0, value2 = 0.0;
   int i1 = 0, i2 = 0;

   /*
      Prompt for values
    */
   printf( "\t\tCalculation Program\n\n" );
   printf( "Please enter two values: " );
   scanf( "%f %f", &value1, &value2 );

   printf( "Their sum: %f\n", value1 + value2 );
   printf( "Their product: %f\n", value1 * value2 );
   printf( "The first minus the second: %f\n", value1 - value2 );
   printf( "The second minus the first: %f\n",  value2 - value1 );
   printf( "The first divided by the second: %f\n", value1 / value2 );
   printf( "The second divided by the first: %f\n", value2 / value1 );

   printf( "Let's try again, as if the values were int\n" );
   i1 = (int) value1;
   i2 = (int) value2;
   printf( "Their sum: %d\n", i1 + i2 );
   printf( "Their product: %d\n", i1 * i2 );
   printf( "The first minus the second: %d\n", i1 - i2 );
   printf( "The second minus the first: %d\n", i2 - i1 );
   printf( "The first divided by the second: %d\n", i1 / i2 );
   /*
      Just for the record, the modulus operator is only
	  defined on int parameters...
    */
   printf( "The modulus of the first by the second: %d\n", i1 % i2 );
   printf( "The second divided by the first: %d\n", i2 / i1 );
   printf( "The modulus of the second by the first: %d\n", i2 % i1 );
   return( 0 );
}
```

## Conditionals

* There is no meaningful program that doesn't demonstrate some basic decision-making skills
* For instance, "I will continue driving through the intersection" is not a statement a human would act upon. But "I will stop if the light is red, go if the light is green, go only if I can safely pass if the light is yellow" might be a reasonable driving policy.
* A conditional tells the computer to only execute a block of code if a particular condition has been satisfied (i.e. that condition is true).
* `if...else` is the most common conditional statement
* `switch...case` are used as a shorthand version of `if...else`
* In C, logic is a form of arithmetic
  * `0` represents false
  * **any** other value represents true
  * Logical and arithmetic operators are treated as the same thing in C

### selection.c

```c
/*
   Let's try writing some conditional logic...
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   float value1 = 0.0, value2 = 0.0;
   /*
      Prompt for values
    */
   printf( "\t\tConditional Logic Program\n\n" );
   printf( "Please enter two values: " );
   scanf( "%f %f", &value1, &value2 );

   if (value1 < value2) {
	   printf( "value1 is less than value2\n" );
   }
   if (value1 > value2) {
	   printf( "value1 is greater than value2\n" );
   }
   if (value1 <= value2) {
	   printf( "value1 is less than or equal value2\n" );
   }
   if (value1 >= value2) {
	   printf( "value1 is greater than or equal value2\n" );
   }
   if (value1 == value2) {
	   printf( "value1 equals value2\n" );
   }
   if (value1 != value2) {
	   printf( "value1 does not equals value2\n" );
   }
   /*
      Just for the record, due to rounding errors, it
	  is very dangerous to test for equality on floating
	  point numbers
    */
   return( 0 );
}
```

### Relational Expressions

* Consider the following relational and equivalence operations

```c
a < b     // 1 if a is less than b, 0 otherwise
a > b     // 1 if a is greater than b, 0 otherwise
a <= b    // 1 if a is less than or equal to b, 0 otherwise
a >= b    // 1 if a is greater than or equal to b, 0 otherwise
a == b    // 1 if a is equal to b, 0 otherwise
a != b    // 1 if a is not equal to b, 0 otherwise
```

* Please remember `=` is for **assignment** and `==` is for **equality**
* C does not have a dedicated boolean type that many programming languages have. Instead, integers represent booleans.
  * 0 means false
  * anything else means true
* Our two examples of conditionals are equivalent:

```c
if (foo()) {
  // do something
}
if (foo() != 0) {
  // do something
}
```

### Logical Expressions

* A way to evaluate operations over logical values (i.e. `0` for false and anything else for true)
* Gives a way to encode "this AND that" or "this OR that"
* Consider the following:

```c
a || b    // 1 when EITHER a OR b is true, 0 otherwise
a && b    // 1 when BOTH a AND b are true, 0 otherwise
!a        // 1 when a is false, 0 otherwise
```

* We can string multiple logical expressions together to create compound logical expressions:

```c
((a && b) || (c > d))
```

## If-Else Statements

* Executes a block of code if particular conditions have been met
* Basic syntax:

```c
if (/* condition goes here */) {
  /* if the condition is non-zero (true), this code will execute */
} else {
  /* if the condition is 0 (false), this code will execute */
}
```

* The first block executes if the condition is true, otherwise the second block executes
* The `else` is completely optional
* An `if` can directly follow an else, creating a chain of conditions to check:

```c
if (a > b) {
  c = a;
} else if (b > a) {
  c = b;
} else {
  c = 0;
}
```

* This code sets the variable `c` equal to the greater of the two variables `a` or `b`, or `0` if `a` and `b` are equal.
* What's the point of the `else` when you can just do this:

```c
if (a > b) {
  c = a;
}

if (a < b) {
  c = b;
}

if (a == b) {
  c = 0;
}
```

1. Multiple `if`'s could be true, there is no guaranteed mutual exclusion
2. Evaluating `if` statements takes time (since the condition must be checked).

* If you only have single statement to statement to execute in your `if` or `else`, you do not need to put a block.
  * **But you should.**
  * Consider the following

```c
if(5 < 10)
  printf("I am inside the if\n");
else
  printf("I am inside the else\n");
  printf("5 is not less than 10\n");
```

* Only the single statement following the `if` or `else` is associated with the conditional...so when will `5 is not less than 10` be printed?
  * **Every time**
  * Indentation cannot be trusted!
  * Here's a version with indentation reflecting the semantics of the program:

```c
if(5 < 10)
  printf("I am inside the if\n");
else
  printf("I am inside the else\n");
printf("5 is not less than 10\n");
```

* How do you fix this?
  * **Always use block statements!**

```c
if(5 < 10) {
  printf("I am inside the if\n");
} else {
  printf("I am inside the else\n");
  printf("5 is not less than 10\n");
}
```

## Nesting

If statements can be nested, meaning you have `if` statements inside of `if` statements

### nesting.c

```c
/*
   Let's try writing some nested conditional statements...
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int temperature;
   /*
      Prompt for values
    */
   printf( "\t\tNested Logic Program\n\n" );
   printf( "Please enter today's temperature: " );
   scanf( "%d", &temperature );

   if (temperature < 50) {
	   printf( "Gosh, it feels cold...\n" );
	   if (temperature < 32) {
		  printf( "And it looks like it's freezing...\n" );
	   }
	   else if (temperature < 40) {
		  printf( "And it's nearly freezing...\n" );
	   }
	   else {
		  printf( "But atleast it's not freezing cold!\n" );
	   }
   }
   else if (temperature > 90) {
	   printf( "Gosh, it's hot...\n" );
	   if (temperature > 110) {
		  printf( "And it's just boiling... head for air conditioning...\n" );
	   }
	   else if (temperature > 100) {
		  printf( "Atleast it's not boiling...\n" );
	   }
	   else {
		  printf( "What a heat wave!!\n" );
	   }
   }
   else {
	   printf( "Doesn't California have a nice climate!\n" );
   }
   return( 0 );
}
```

* The condiitonal expression is an if statement that can be assigned to a variable. It is commonly called the _ternary operator_
    * The syntax is the following:

```c
(/* logical expression goes here */) ? (/* if non-zero (true) */) : (/* if 0 (false) */)
```

* If the logical expression is true, the overall condition evaluates to the expression between the `?` and the `:`.
* If the logical expression is false, the overall condition evaluates to the expression after the `:`
* For example, if we want to set `c` to be the larger value of two variables `a` and `b`, we could write the following:

```c
c = (a > b) ? a : b;
```

## Switch-Case Statement

* It's generally bad practice to string together more than two or three `if..else` statements together. The `switch...case` statement enables us to write many "cases" that could be handled by `if...else` in a cleaner manner
* Basic syntax:

```c
 switch (/* integer or enum goes here */) {
 case /* potential value of the aforementioned int or enum */:
   /* code */
 case /* a different potential value */:
   /* different code */
 /* insert additional cases as needed */
 default:
   /* more code */
 }
```

* The switch uses a variable, and integer or enum, to control which case to evaluate. This is a limiation; if you must compare more complicated data, you cannot use a `switch...case`
* This variable is compared against each `case`, one the comparison is true, that particular case will activate (execute)
  * Once a `case` has been activated, no other cases will be evaluated
* Typically, the last statement for each case is a `break` statement. The causes the program to jump to the statement following the closing `}` of the switch statement.
  * This basically ends the switch statement (and this behavior is probably your intuition behind each case
  * However, if you omit the `break`, the cases "fall throw" until the end of the switch or until a `break` is reached
* If no cases are matched and a `default` case is specified, the default case will execute.
  * Use of `default` is optional.

		integer values based on the ASCII table which
