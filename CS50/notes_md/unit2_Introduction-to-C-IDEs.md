# Introduction to C & IDEs

* See online notes on Visual Studio and Xcode

## Hello, World!

* First intro program.
* The program will print the text "Hello, World!" onto the screen.
* That's it.

### hello_world.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

* Let's break this down:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

* This is a _preprocessor directive_. We'll talk more about the preprocessor later.
* For now, think of this as a step that happens before _compilation_
  * Compilation is the process of converting your C program into machine code)
* Here, we are using the `#include` directive to tell the preprocessor to get the `stdio.h` file and include in our program
  * "Include" in this sense means bring the source code of `stdio.h` into this project
  * This prevents us from having to re-invent the wheel - we can easily bring in existing code into our projects and use it.
  * For this example, we only need to `printf` function from `stdio.h`
  * Files that end in `.h` are called _header files_. We'll talk more about headers later.
* The `main` _function_ is the entry point of all C programs. The computer needs to know where to start your program. `main` is the starting point.
* `printf("Hello, World!");` prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console
* `return 0;` terminates the program to let the operating system whether or not the program terminated successfully.
  * `0` indicates success in this case

## Preliminaries

### Comments

1. Single-line comments start with `//`
    * Example:

```c
// this is a single-line comment
```

2. Variable-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`
    * If you have a multi-line comment, each line beings with `*` after starting the comment

```c
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment
 */
```

### Block Structure, Statements, Whitespace, Scope

#### Statement

* A **statement** is a command given to the computer that instructs the computer to take a specific action
  * Think of statements as the most atomic unit of our programs.
  * A program is made up of some sequence of statements
  * Statements terminate with the the semicolon `;` character
* An example statement: `int x = 1;`
  * This statement **delcares** a **variable** named `x` and **initializes** `x` to have the value `1`.
  * This value of `1` can be **accessed** or **modified** with the **identifier** `x`
* Understanding check:
  * What does it mean to declare a variable?
  * What does a variable store?
  * How can we access the value of a particular variable?

#### Blocks

* **Blocks** consists of a group of executable **statements**
* Blocks begin with `{` and end with `}`
* Example:

```c
int main(void)
{
  /* this is a 'block' */
  int i = 5;
  {
    /* this is also a 'block', nested inside the outer block */
    int i = 6;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Whitespace

* Whitespace in a C program refers to tabs, spaces, and newline characters that separate text in the source code.
* Whitespace is ignored in many instances in C programs.
* The following are equivalent to a C compiler

```c
printf("Hello world"); return 0;
```

```c
printf("Hello world");
return 0;
```

```c
printf(
"Hello world");


return 0;
```

* When does the compiler not ignore whitespace?
  * Whitespace is important when using any **keyword** in C, such as `return`, `int` and others.

#### Scope

* Two types of scope: **global** and **local**
* Global indicates something can be seen or manipulated from anywhere in the program
* Local indicates something can be seen or manipulated from anywhere in the program
* Example:

```c
int i = 5; /* this is a 'global' variable, it can be accessed from anywhere in the program */

/* this is a function, all variables inside of it are "local" to the function. */
int main(void)
{
    int i = 6; /* 'i' now equals 6 */
    printf("%d\n", i); /* prints a '6' to the screen, instead of the global variable of 'i', which is 5 */

    return 0;
}
```

* What do we see from this example?
  * Local scope supersedes global
* A more complicated example:

```c
/* the main function */
int main(void)
{
    /* this is the beginning of a 'block', you read about those above */

    int i = 6; /* this is the first variable of this 'block', 'i' */

    {
        /* this is a new 'block', and because it's a different block, it has its own scope */

        /* this is also a variable called 'i', but in a different 'block',
            because it's in a different 'block' than the old 'i', it doesn't affect the old one! */
        int i = 5;
        printf("%d\n", i); /* prints a '5' onto the screen */
    }
    /* now we're back into the old block */

    printf("%d\n", i); /* prints a '6' onto the screen */

    return 0;
}
```

## Basic Function Use

* We will take extensively about functions later in the course, but we need to have a basic introduction now - we need to know the basics to succeed in this course
* A **function** is a special kind of block that performs a well-defined task
* It enables programmers to perform a task without knowing how the function works
  * A form of _information hiding_
* When you **call** a function, you are telling the computer to execute the entire function code block in a single statement
  * The function invoking the function is called the **caller**
  * The function being called is called the **callee**
* Many functions require data as input
  * This data is passed to the function as **arguments**
* Many functions return a value to the caller
  * This is called a **return value**
* What you should know before calling a function:
  * What the function does
  * The data type of the arguments are and what they mean
  * The data type of the return value and what it means

## The Standard Library

* A collection of standard functions provided to you as the programmer to make programming easier, more secure, more robust, and more standardized
* `#include <stdio.h>` includes the standard library file `stdio.h` which stands for _standard IO_
  * We used this header to bring in the `printf` function, which is a part of IO
